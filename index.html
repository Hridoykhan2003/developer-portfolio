            <h3>Innovation is the outcome of a habit, not a random act</h3>
            <p>Technology is best when it brings people together. The Web as I envisaged it, we have not seen it yet. The future is still so much bigger than
                the
                past. Once a new technology rolls over you, if you're not part of the steamroller, you're part of the
                road.
                It's not a faith in technology. It's faith in people.</p>

            <p>One machine can do the work of fifty ordinary men. No machine can do the work of one extraordinary man.
                For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be
                fooled. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. You affect the world by
                what you browse.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Is artificial intelligence less than our intelligence?</h3>
                <p>When it comes to the possibilities and possible perils of artificial intelligence (AI), learning and
                    reasoning by machines without the intervention of humans, there are lots of opinions out there Until
                    we get
                    there, it’s interesting to contemplate who might be the one who predicts our reality the best.
                    Generative AI is the key to solving some of the world’s biggest problems, such as climate change,
                    poverty, and disease..</p>

                <h3 class="title">Robotics is not about making machines to serve us!</h3>
                <p>We have artificial intelligence, virtual reality, augmented reality, 3D-printing, robotics and
                    nanotechnology that have changed the face of modern medicine. Sometimes a technology is so
                    awe-inspiring that the imagination runs away with it - often far, far away from reality. Robots are
                    like that. A lot of big and ultimately unfulfilled promises were made in robotics early on, based on
                    preliminary successes..</p>
